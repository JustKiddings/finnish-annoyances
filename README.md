# Finnish Annoyances
Finnish Annoyances is a list which hides all unnecessary elements and blocks unnecessary connections. </br>
By using Finnish Annoyances you will get a cleaner look in many websites.

The list is still under development but at the moment it covers most visited finnish websites.

## To-Do
- [ ] README.md in finnish
- [ ] Cover more websites
- [ ] Make specific lists

List doesn't cover specific website? </br>
Open an [issue](https://github.com/axonym/finnish-annoyances/issues) or make filter for that site yourself! AdGuard has great [guide](https://adguard.com/kb/general/ad-filtering/create-own-filters/) on how to create filters.

Bad filters or problems? Let me know through [issues](https://github.com/axonym/finnish-annoyances/issues)
